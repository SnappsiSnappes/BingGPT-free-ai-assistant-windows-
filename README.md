# Functionality
The bot uses the Bing and GPT-3.5-turbo APIs to respond to user prompts. The bot is initialized with a recognizer object and wake word variables. When the bot hears the wake word, it waits for the user to say a prompt. The prompt is then passed to the appropriate API, and the response is synthesized into speech and played back to the user.
